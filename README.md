# What is this?

This is meant to be a simple learning tool for deciphering different difficulty levels of ciphers.

You decide the message to encrypt, what encryption method to use and then print the result on paper.

Examples on how to use it (after printing it the encrypted message to paper):

* Keep the legend attached (easy)
* Cut away the legend, but give hints by deciphering one or more characters (intermediate)
* Cut away the legend (advanced)

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by
the [Laracasts](https://www.laracasts.com/) [Codebreaker](https://github.com/laracasts/codebreaker/) series.
The major difference is that this is a fully static web page with no server side dependencies. There's also more ciphers
available than in the original.
